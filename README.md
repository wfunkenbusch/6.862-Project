Purpose: This project creates a neural network based on the Ki from protein ligand pairs found in the BindingDB database

Data table: "BindingDB_PDSPKi3.tsv" - tsv file with Ki of approx 27k protein-ligand pairs from BindingDB database

Step 1:
"Applied_machine_learning_Datacuration.ipynb" - Open this file and run it. It will curate the protein DB file (formatting SMILES, AA chains) so that a neural network can be run on the information. It will take in "BindingDB_PDSPKi3.tsv" and output the excel file "curated_df.xlsx"

Step 2:
....

Step 3:

Step 4:

"curated_df.xlsx" - excel file with curated data to be used by neural network
